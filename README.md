# CS12320_Main-Assignment

This is my submission for my main assignment for the Programming Using an Object Oriented Language module for my first year of university. I recieved an overall mark of 91% in this module. 

It is a quiz program where teachers can create quizzes of different types with questions in two different languages. Students can then take these quizzes within the same program and get assessed by it. The program is interacted with using a textual interface.
